# sbom-mini-toolchain

Your minmal Open Source SBoM toolchain. 

## Introduction 
SBoMs (Software Bill of Material) play an increasingly important role in software development. SBoMs are an enabler for maintaining software security, as well as for Open Source compliance.

Therefore creation and processing of SBoMs is today considered state of the art in professional software projects.

As a hobby developer you might wonder 
- whether you should also think about creating an SBoM for your GitHub software project
- how to create an SBoM 

This is where sbom-mini-toolchain comes into play: this repo shows you how to create and process SBoMs by utilizing different Open Source SBoM tools.

This repo consists of:
- **SBoM tools**: see folder **tools**
- **command line scripts**: see **.cmd** files in the root folder
